## About this tutorial

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a common method of data analysis. The original data is linearly
transformed into a set of representations of which each dimension is linear independent. This can be used
to extract the main feature components of the data. PCA is often used to reduce the dimension of highdimensional
data.

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the basic mathematical theories of PCA and help readers
understand the working mechanism of PCA. Additionally, I do not intend to write this tutorial as a pure
mathematical article, but I hope to describe the mathematical principles of PCA in an intuitive and easyto-
understand way. Therefore, the whole article will not introduce strict mathematical derivation.
